# Feature Specification: ClipForge Desktop Video Editor

**Feature Branch**: `001-clipforge`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a Desktop Video Editor - ClipForge"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Import and Basic Video Playback (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

A creator wants to start editing by bringing video files into the application and previewing them before making any edits. This is the foundational capability that all editing workflows depend on.

**Why this priority**: Without the ability to import and view videos, no editing workflow is possible. This establishes the core media pipeline and validates that the application can handle video files correctly across different formats and resolutions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the app, importing a single MP4 file via drag-and-drop or file picker, and playing it back in the preview window. Delivers immediate value by allowing users to organize and preview their video assets.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is launched, **When** user drags an MP4 file into the window, **Then** the file appears in the media library with thumbnail and metadata
2. **Given** a video file is in the media library, **When** user clicks on it, **Then** the video loads in the preview player and displays the first frame
3. **Given** a video is loaded in the preview player, **When** user clicks play, **Then** video plays with synchronized audio at proper frame rate
4. **Given** video is playing, **When** user clicks pause, **Then** video pauses at current frame and audio stops
5. **Given** the app is open, **When** user clicks "Import" and selects multiple video files (MP4, MOV, WebM), **Then** all files appear in media library with correct durations

---

### User Story 2 - Timeline Editing and Trimming (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

A creator wants to arrange video clips on a timeline, trim unwanted sections, and create a cohesive sequence by removing unnecessary footage and reordering clips.

**Why this priority**: This is the core editing functionality. Once users can import videos (P1), they need to arrange and trim them to create their final video. This completes the basic editing loop.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by importing 2-3 clips, dragging them onto the timeline, trimming each clip by setting in/out points, splitting a clip at the playhead, and previewing the result. Delivers the essential editing capabilities needed for any video project.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** video clips are in media library, **When** user drags a clip onto timeline, **Then** clip appears on timeline with visual representation and duration
2. **Given** clips are on timeline, **When** user drags clips to reorder them, **Then** clips rearrange in new sequence and preview updates
3. **Given** a clip is on timeline, **When** user sets in/out points and clicks trim, **Then** clip shortens to selected portion
4. **Given** timeline has a clip, **When** user positions playhead and clicks split, **Then** clip divides into two separate clips at that point
5. **Given** timeline has multiple clips, **When** user clicks play, **Then** preview plays all clips in sequence with smooth transitions
6. **Given** user is editing timeline, **When** user zooms timeline view, **Then** timeline scale changes for precise frame-level editing

---

### User Story 3 - Video Export (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

A creator has finished editing their video and wants to export it as a standard video file they can upload to social media, share with collaborators, or archive.

**Why this priority**: Without export, the editing work is trapped in the app. Export completes the editing workflow and delivers the final product. This must work reliably to validate the entire editing pipeline.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a simple timeline with 2-3 edited clips and exporting it as MP4 at 1080p. User can then play the exported file in any video player to verify it matches their timeline. Delivers the final output that makes all editing work valuable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** timeline has edited clips, **When** user clicks Export, **Then** export dialog appears with resolution options (720p, 1080p, source)
2. **Given** export dialog is open, **When** user selects resolution and output location, **Then** export begins with progress indicator showing percentage complete
3. **Given** export is in progress, **When** export completes, **Then** app shows success message with file location
4. **Given** export completed, **When** user opens exported file in external player, **Then** video plays correctly with all edits applied, audio synchronized, and expected quality
5. **Given** export is in progress, **When** user cancels export, **Then** export stops, partial file is cleaned up, and user returns to editing

### User Story 4 - Screen and Webcam Recording (Priority: P2)

A creator wants to record their screen activity (for tutorials, presentations, or gameplay) and/or webcam footage directly within the video editor, immediately adding recordings to their timeline for editing.

**Why this priority**: Recording is a key differentiator for ClipForge, but not strictly required for basic editing. Users can import externally recorded videos for the MVP. This adds substantial value for content creators who need all-in-one recording and editing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching screen recording, capturing 30 seconds of activity, stopping the recording, and verifying it appears in media library ready for editing. Then test webcam recording separately, and finally test simultaneous screen+webcam recording. Delivers professional recording capabilities without needing external tools.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** app is open, **When** user clicks "Record Screen", **Then** screen selector appears showing available screens and windows
2. **Given** screen selector is open, **When** user selects a screen/window and clicks start, **Then** recording begins with indicator showing elapsed time and recording status
3. **Given** recording is in progress, **When** user clicks stop, **Then** recording ends and automatically appears in media library as a new clip
4. **Given** app is open, **When** user clicks "Record Webcam", **Then** webcam preview appears with available camera options
5. **Given** webcam preview is shown, **When** user starts recording, **Then** webcam footage records with audio from microphone
6. **Given** user wants picture-in-picture, **When** user enables "Screen + Webcam" mode and records, **Then** both screen and webcam record simultaneously as layered video
7. **Given** recording is active, **When** user selects audio source (system audio, microphone, or both), **Then** recording captures selected audio streams

---

### User Story 5 - Multi-Track Timeline with Overlay Support (Priority: P3)

A creator wants to layer video clips on multiple tracks to create picture-in-picture effects, overlays, or B-roll footage on top of their main content, with the ability to position and resize overlay clips.

**Why this priority**: Single-track editing (P1) covers most basic use cases. Multi-track support enables more sophisticated compositions but isn't required for basic video editing. This is valuable for creators making tutorials, reaction videos, or professional content with multiple video sources.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by placing a main clip on track 1, adding a second clip on track 2, positioning it as a smaller overlay in the corner, and exporting to verify the layered composition renders correctly. Delivers professional multi-source video capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** timeline has a main clip on track 1, **When** user drags another clip to track 2, **Then** second clip appears as overlay on preview
2. **Given** clip is on overlay track, **When** user resizes and repositions it in preview, **Then** overlay size and position update in real-time
3. **Given** multiple tracks exist, **When** user adjusts track order, **Then** layering priority changes (higher tracks appear on top)
4. **Given** overlay clip is on timeline, **When** timeline plays, **Then** overlay appears correctly positioned throughout its duration
5. **Given** multi-track timeline exists, **When** user exports video, **Then** all tracks composite correctly with overlays rendered at proper positions and sizes

### User Story 6 - Auto-Generated Captions with Speech-to-Text (Priority: P4)

A creator wants to automatically generate captions for their video by analyzing the audio track, making their content more accessible and engaging without manual transcription work.

**Why this priority**: Captions are valuable for accessibility and engagement but not essential for core editing. Many creators add captions as a final polish step. This is a powerful differentiator that leverages AI capabilities while keeping processing local for privacy and speed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by importing or recording a video with clear speech, clicking "Generate Captions", waiting for processing to complete, and verifying that timestamped captions appear synced to the audio. User can then edit caption text and timing. Delivers automated transcription that would otherwise require manual effort or paid services.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** timeline has a video with spoken audio, **When** user clicks "Generate Captions", **Then** system extracts audio and begins speech recognition processing with progress indicator
2. **Given** caption generation is complete, **When** captions appear on timeline, **Then** each caption displays with correct timestamp and syncs to spoken words during playback
3. **Given** captions exist, **When** user clicks a caption, **Then** caption text becomes editable and user can fix transcription errors
4. **Given** captions are on timeline, **When** user adjusts caption timing, **Then** captions shift to match new start/end times
5. **Given** video has captions, **When** user exports, **Then** captions burn into video or export as separate subtitle file (SRT)
6. **Given** video is in non-English language, **When** user selects language before generation, **Then** speech recognition uses appropriate language model

### User Story 7 - Effects and Enhancements (Priority: P5)

A creator wants to enhance their video with text overlays, transitions between clips, basic visual filters, and audio adjustments to make their content more polished and professional.

**Why this priority**: These are polish features that enhance production value but aren't required for functional editing. Creators can produce complete videos without effects. This adds creative flexibility for users who want more sophisticated output.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a text overlay to a clip, applying a fade transition between two clips, adjusting brightness/contrast on a clip, and setting audio volume levels. Preview and export to verify all effects render correctly. Delivers creative tools for professional-looking content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** timeline has a clip, **When** user adds text overlay, **Then** text editor appears with font, size, color, and position controls
2. **Given** text overlay exists, **When** user adjusts position and formatting, **Then** text updates in preview with chosen styling
3. **Given** two clips are adjacent on timeline, **When** user applies transition (fade, slide, etc.), **Then** clips blend smoothly during playback with selected effect
4. **Given** clip is selected, **When** user opens effects panel and adjusts brightness/contrast/saturation sliders, **Then** preview updates in real-time with visual changes
5. **Given** clip has audio, **When** user adjusts volume slider or applies fade in/out, **Then** audio level changes during playback
6. **Given** effects are applied, **When** user exports video, **Then** all visual and audio effects render into final output
