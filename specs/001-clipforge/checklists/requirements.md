# Specification Quality Checklist: ClipForge Desktop Video Editor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-27

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification avoids mentioning specific frameworks (Tauri, FFmpeg, Svelte are in user's original input but not prescribed as requirements in the spec). All requirements focus on capabilities, not implementation.

✅ **User value focused**: Each user story clearly articulates value from creator's perspective. Success criteria emphasize user-facing outcomes.

✅ **Non-technical language**: Specification uses plain language understandable by product managers, designers, and business stakeholders.

✅ **Complete sections**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated with concrete details.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification needed**: All requirements are sufficiently specified with reasonable defaults applied. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement can be verified through specific test actions (e.g., "System MUST import video files" can be tested by importing a file and checking media library).

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics (time, percentage, fps, etc.) or verifiable outcomes.

✅ **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria focus on user experience (e.g., "launches in under 5 seconds", "timeline remains responsive") rather than technical implementation details.

✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story includes Given-When-Then scenarios covering normal flows and variations.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 12 edge cases documented covering file handling, system resources, permissions, performance limits, and error conditions.

✅ **Clear scope**: User stories are prioritized P1-P7, with MVP clearly marked (P1 stories). Boundaries established between core and enhancement features.

✅ **Dependencies clear**: User story priorities and relationships are explicit (e.g., P2 recording depends on P1 import/preview infrastructure).

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Functional requirements mapped**: 69 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-069) align with user stories and cover all scenarios.

✅ **Primary flows covered**: All critical workflows documented: import → edit → export (MVP), plus recording, multi-track, captions, and effects.

✅ **Success criteria aligned**: 27 success criteria cover all major feature areas with measurable targets.

✅ **Implementation-free**: Specification maintains clean separation between "what" (requirements) and "how" (implementation).

## Notes

- Specification is comprehensive and well-structured
- Prioritization enables incremental MVP delivery (P1 stories form complete minimal product)
- User stories are independently testable as required
- Reasonable defaults applied throughout (e.g., standard frame rates, common codecs, typical hardware expectations)
- No blocking issues identified - ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Recommendations for Planning Phase

1. **MVP Focus**: Prioritize P1 stories (US1, US2, US3) for initial implementation - these form a complete basic video editor
2. **Recording complexity**: P2 recording features require platform-specific APIs - plan for this technical complexity
3. **Performance testing**: Given performance requirements (SC-004 through SC-009), establish performance benchmarking early
4. **Cross-platform**: Success criteria require both macOS and Windows support - consider platform differences in planning
5. **Caption feature**: P4 speech-to-text requires AI model integration - this is architecturally significant
