# Tasks: ClipForge Desktop Video Editor

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-clipforge/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests follow TDD for critical paths (media import, FFmpeg operations, timeline state, export pipeline). Trivial operations may skip tests per constitution guidance. Focus on meaningful test coverage that catches production issues.

**Branching Strategy**: Create a new branch for each phase to isolate work and enable clean PRs.

```bash
# Example: Starting Phase 4 (User Story 2)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b 004-timeline-editing

# After completing phase, push and create PR
git push origin 004-timeline-editing
# Create PR: 004-timeline-editing ‚Üí main
```

**CI/CD Validation**: After completing each phase, run all CI/CD checks locally to ensure everything passes before moving to the next phase. See README.md for complete instructions.

```bash
# Quick CI/CD validation (run from project root)
npm test && npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run format:check && \
cd src-tauri && cargo test && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check
```

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Desktop app (Tauri)**: `src-tauri/src/` for Rust backend, `src/` for Svelte frontend
- Paths shown below follow Tauri project structure from plan.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Project Management (Phase 8)**: Can start after Foundational, runs parallel to user stories
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Depends on US1 for media library state
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Depends on US2 for timeline state
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on P1 stories (creates new media clips)
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after US2 complete - Extends timeline functionality

### Within Each User Story

- Models/types before services and commands
- Rust commands before Svelte components that call them
- Core components before integration/wiring tasks
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Models and types within each story marked [P] can run in parallel
- UI components marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members (after Foundational complete)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all parallel tasks for US1 together:
T027: Implement import_media_files command
T028: Implement get_media_metadata command
T029: Create FFmpeg metadata extraction
T030: Create FFmpeg thumbnail generation
T032: Create MediaLibrary component
T033: Create MediaClipCard component
T034: Create VideoPreview component

# Then run sequential tasks:
T031: Implement thumbnail task queue (depends on T030)
T035: Implement drag-drop import (depends on T027, T032)
# ... and so on
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Import & Playback)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Timeline Editing)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 + US2 together
7. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Export)
8. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test full MVP workflow (import ‚Üí edit ‚Üí export)
9. Deploy/demo MVP

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP v0.1!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP v0.2)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP v1.0 - complete editing workflow)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (v1.1 - recording)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (v1.2 - multi-track)
7. Add Project Management (Phase 8) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (v1.3 - save/load)
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T027-T040)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T041-T061)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T062-T075)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- MVP = User Stories 1-3 only (import ‚Üí edit ‚Üí export)
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Tests are OPTIONAL - focus on implementation first, add tests later if needed

---
